Let's make sure our environments are set up properly.

First, clone the repository and cd to the directory. To install the dependencies, run

    npm install
  
To start the application, run

    npm start

If you want automatic reloading, run

    npm install nodemon

then edit `package.json` to change `"node ./bin/www"` to `nodemon ./bin/www`. Start the app again with

    npm start
